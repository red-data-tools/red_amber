## Overview
* RedAmber is a dataframe library written in ruby. It uses columnar memory format based on [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/).
* Our goal is to manipulate data frames in a Ruby-like writing style using blocks and collections.
* You can easily try RedAmber with [Dev Container](https://containers.dev/). See [RedAmber Dev Container](doc/Dev_Containers.md).
* We have [rich document with many examples](https://red-data-tools.github.io/red_amber/) and Jupyter Notebook with 127 operation examples. See [RedAmber Dev Container](doc/Dev_Containers.md).

## Requirements
### Ruby
Supported Ruby version is >= 3.0.

### Required libraries
```ruby
plugin "rubygems-requirements-system" # Requires system packages automatically.

gem 'red-arrow',   '>= 12.0.0' # Requires Apache Arrow (see installation below).
gem 'red-arrow-numo-narray'    # Optional, recommended if you use inputs from Numo::NArray,
                               # or use random sampling feature.

```

## Installation

You need to install the following libraries. You can automate it by enabling
`rubygems-requirements-system`. If you want to install these libraries manually,
see [Apache Arrow install document](https://arrow.apache.org/install/).

- Apache Arrow (>= 12.0.0)
- Apache Arrow GLib (>= 12.0.0)
- Apache Parquet GLib (>= 12.0.0)  # If you use IO from/to parquet

If you want to install RedAmber and related gems by Bundler, you can add the
followings to your Gemfile. And then execute `bundle install`.

```ruby
plugin "rubygems-requirements-system"

gem 'red-arrow',   '>= 12.0.0'
gem 'red_amber'
gem 'red-arrow-numo-narray'    # Optional, recommended if you use inputs from Numo::NArray
                               # or use random sampling feature.
gem 'red-parquet', '>= 12.0.0' # Optional, if you use IO from/to parquet

```

If you want to install RedAmber by RubyGems, you can use the following command
line.

```bash
gem install rubygems-requirements-system red_amber
```

## Development Containers

This repository supports [Dev Containers](https://containers.dev/). You can create a container as a full-featured development environment for RedAmber. The environment includes Ruby, Apache Arrow, RedAmber with source tree, GitHub CLI, sample datasets and Jupyter Lab with IRuby kernel. And you don't need to worry about the change of your local environment.

`.devcontainer` directory in this repository includes settings of Dev Container for RedAmber.
Please refer [How to use Dev Containers in RedAmber](doc/Dev_Containers.md) to use it.

## Docker image and Jupyter Notebook

(Notice: This feature may be removed in the future. Try Dev Container above.)

Docker image is available from `docker` folder. See [readme](docker/readme.md) for instruction. Integrated Jypyter notebook is in docker/notebook folder.

You can try the contents of this README interactively by [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/heronshoes/docker-stacks/RedAmber-binder?filepath=red-amber.ipynb).
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/heronshoes/docker-stacks/RedAmber-binder?filepath=red-amber.ipynb)

[RubyData Docker Stacks](https://github.com/RubyData/docker-stacks) is available as a ready-to-run Docker image containing Jupyter and useful data tools as well as RedAmber (Thanks to Kenta Murata).

## Comparison of DataFrames

Comparison of  basic features of RedAmber with Python
[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/),
R [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) and
Julia [Dataframes](https://dataframes.juliadata.org/stable/) is in [DataFrame_Comparison.md](doc/DataFrame_Comparison.md) (Thanks to Benson Muite).

## Data frame in `RedAmber`

Class `RedAmber::DataFrame` represents a set of data in 2D-shape.
Its entity is a Red Arrow's Table object.

![dataframe model of RedAmber](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/red-data-tools/red_amber/main/doc/image/dataframe_model.png)

Let's load the library and try some examples.

```ruby
require 'red_amber' # require 'red-amber' is also OK.
include RedAmber
```

### Example: diamonds dataset

First do (if you do not installed) `
gem install red-datasets-arrow
`
then

```ruby
require 'datasets-arrow' # to load sample data

dataset = Datasets::Diamonds.new
diamonds = DataFrame.new(dataset) # before v0.2.3, should be `dataset.to_arrow`

# =>
#<RedAmber::DataFrame : 53940 x 10 Vectors, 0x000000000000f668>
         carat cut       color    clarity     depth    table    price        x ...        z

    0     0.23 Ideal     E        SI2          61.5     55.0      326     3.95 ...     2.43
    1     0.21 Premium   E        SI1          59.8     61.0      326     3.89 ...     2.31
    2     0.23 Good      E        VS1          56.9     65.0      327     4.05 ...     2.31
    3     0.29 Premium   I        VS2          62.4     58.0      334      4.2 ...     2.63
    4     0.31 Good      J        SI2          63.3     58.0      335     4.34 ...     2.75
    :        : :         :        :               :        :        :        : ...        :
53937      0.7 Very Good D        SI1          62.8     60.0     2757     5.66 ...     3.56
53938     0.86 Premium   H        SI2          61.0     58.0     2757     6.15 ...     3.74
53939     0.75 Ideal     D        SI2          62.2     55.0     2757     5.83 ...     3.64
```

For example, we can compute mean prices per cut for the data larger than 1 carat.

```ruby
df = diamonds
  .slice { carat > 1 } # or use #filter instead of #slice
  .group(:cut)
  .mean(:price) # `pick` prior to `group` is not required if `:price` is specified here.
  .sort('-mean(price)')

# =>
#<RedAmber::DataFrame : 5 x 2 Vectors, 0x000000000000f67c>
  cut       mean(price)
  <string>     <double>
0 Ideal         8674.23
1 Premium       8487.25
2 Very Good     8340.55
3 Good           7753.6
4 Fair          7177.86
```

Arrow data is immutable, so these methods always return new objects.
Next example will rename a column and create a new column by simple calcuration.

```ruby
usdjpy = 110.0 # when the yen was stronger

df.rename('mean(price)': :mean_price_USD)
  .assign(:mean_price_JPY) { mean_price_USD * usdjpy }

# =>
#<RedAmber::DataFrame : 5 x 3 Vectors, 0x000000000000f71c>
  cut       mean_price_USD mean_price_JPY
  <string>        <double>       <double>
0 Ideal            8674.23      954164.93
1 Premium          8487.25      933597.34
2 Very Good        8340.55      917460.37
3 Good              7753.6      852896.11
4 Fair             7177.86      789564.12
```

### Example: starwars dataset

Next example is `starwars` dataset reading from the downloaded CSV file. Followed by minimum data cleaning.

```ruby
uri = URI('https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/dplyr/starwars.csv')

starwars = DataFrame.load(uri)

starwars
  .drop(0) # delete unnecessary index column
  .remove { species == "NA" } # delete unnecessary rows
  .group(:species) { [count(:species), mean(:height, :mass)] }
  .slice { count > 1 } # or use #filter instead of slice

# =>
#<RedAmber::DataFrame : 8 x 4 Vectors, 0x000000000000f848>
  species    count mean(height) mean(mass)
  <string> <int64>     <double>   <double>
0 Human         35       176.65      82.78
1 Droid          6        131.2      69.75
2 Wookiee        2        231.0      124.0
3 Gungan         3       208.67       74.0
4 Zabrak         2        173.0       80.0
5 Twi'lek        2        179.0       55.0
6 Mirialan       2        168.0       53.1
7 Kaminoan       2        221.0       88.0
```

See [DataFrame.md](doc/DataFrame.md) for other examples and details.


### `Vector` for 1D data object in column

Class `RedAmber::Vector` represents a series of data in the DataFrame.

See [Vector.md](doc/Vector.md) for details.

## Jupyter notebook

We are managing the source of Jupyter Notebook in qmd format by Quarto. You can easily create Notebooks and try it with Jupyter Lab in [Dev Container](doc/Dev_Containers.md).

## Development

The recommended way to develop RedAmber is to use Dev Container. Please refer [How to use Dev Containers in RedAmber](doc/Dev_Containers.md) to use it.

Otherwise run below commands after install required libraries in your local system.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/red-data-tools/red_amber.git
cd red_amber
bundle install
bundle exec rake test
```

We need to pass `rake test` in development of RedAmber, but not require to pass `rake rubocop` when you make a contribution. In this project we respect your preferences in code style. However, we may unify the style during merging.
