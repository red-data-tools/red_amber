## Install

```
git clone https://github.com/heronshoes/red_amber.git
cd  docker
```

Edit ENV variable in `.env` as you like.

[note] NB_USER is fixed for `jovyan`, the common user name in Jupyter,
can not change it in this version.

If TZ is not used in your host system, define it here.
Otherwise UTC is used in the container.

TOKEN will be used for token-based authentication.

```
# Example
TZ=Asia/Tokyo
TOKEN='something'
```

Then build `red_amber-minimal-notebook` container. It will take a while.

```
docker compose build
```

## Start Jupyter Lab

After build, start the container. Adding `-d` option will detach it in background.

```
docker compose up
```

You can access Jupyter Lab from `http://localhost:8888/` in your browser.

- `red-amber.ipynb`:
  - Walks through the [README of RedAmber](https://github.com/heronshoes/red_amber#readme).
- `examples_of_red_amber.ipynb`:
  - [Examples of RedAmber](https://github.com/heronshoes/red_amber/blob/main/docker/notebook/examples_of_red_amber.ipynb) in Notebook style.

## Example in REPL

You can try RedAmber in irb with pre-loaded datasets.

Start `terminal` in Jupyter.

For the first run,

```
source ~/.bashrc
../example

```

It will take a while for the first run to fetch and prepare red-datasets cache.

If irb starts you can see:

```ruby

    69: # Welcome to RedAmber example!
    70: # This environment will offer these pre-loaded datasets:
    71: #   penguins, diamonds, iris, starwars, simpsons_paradox_covid,
    72: #   mtcars, band_members, band_instruments, band_instruments2
    73: #   (original) import_cars, comecome, dataframe, subframes
 => 74: binding.irb

irb(main):001:0> 
```

RedAmber is already loaded in this environment with some datasets shown above.

```ruby
irb(main):002:0> dataframe
=> 
#<RedAmber::DataFrame : 6 x 3 Vectors, 0x0000000000003818>
        x y        z
  <uint8> <string> <boolean>
0       1 A        false
1       2 A        true
2       3 B        false
3       4 B        (nil)
4       5 B        true
5       6 C        false
```

Next time you start this environment, you can simply invoke as `../example`.
